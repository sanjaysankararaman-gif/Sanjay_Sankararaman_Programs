# Typing Trainer

A blind typing exercise built in Python. The program plays a pre-recorded audio clip of a letter and the user has to type that letter without seeing it on screen, training typing accuracy by ear rather than by sight.

## How It Works

- A random letter is selected and its corresponding `.wav` file is played using `pygame.mixer`
- The user types their guess, and the program checks it against the correct letter
- Letters are prompted in both uppercase and lowercase to test case-sensitivity
- Two modes are available: Practice Mode and Test Mode

## Tech Used

- **Python**
- `pygame.mixer` — loading and playing the `.wav` audio files
- `random` — selecting letters and case variation
- `time` — tracking response time
- `select` / `sys` — non-blocking keyboard input, so the program keeps listening without pausing execution

## Notable Bugs Fixed

- **Timer starting early** — the response timer was starting before the audio had finished playing, throwing off the timing. Fixed by moving the `time.time()` snapshot to after the `channel.get_busy()` check, so the clock only starts once the audio is confirmed done.
- **Case handling bug** — the uppercase/lowercase conversion logic was scoped incorrectly inside the main loop, causing inconsistent case prompts. Moved outside the loop so it applies correctly.
- **Letter mismatch** — an issue in random letter generation occasionally caused the audio played and the expected answer to not line up.
- **Missing break statements** — a few loops were missing `break` conditions, letting the program run past where it should have stopped.

## What I'd Add Next

I would like to bring in AI integration in understanding the mistakes made by the user. After understanding it, the AI must be able to bring in by letters in the exercise for the user to improve.
I am also planning on making the user interface similar to the very popular webiste MonkeyType and want to bring in all the functionality that it has and make it better. 

The future goal is to develop to the point where it can help the user to be a master at "Touch Typing" and typing without any mistakes fluently and with ease.
